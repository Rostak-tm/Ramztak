Welcome to **Ramztak** ‚Äì a cutting-edge crypto trading simulator bot for Telegram! This project leverages robust trading logic to simulate real-time cryptocurrency trading using live Binance data. While a fully-featured Telegram interface is available, the core trading logic is designed to be modular. This means you, as a contributor, can easily develop and integrate additional interfaces (web, mobile, desktop, etc.) to expand the functionality of **Ramztak**. üí°
